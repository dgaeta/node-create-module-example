# node-create-module-example
An example of how to create your own custom node module; as well as how to use it in your own program. 


The example module provided is a simple function that reads command line 
arguments to print filenames in a directory that a particular file name 
extension. 

I.E. 'print all files in directory that match txt extentsion'. 

The program requires that the first command line argument be a path to the 
directory name of interest, and the second command line argument be a 
filename extension (with the '.', i.e. 'txt').
